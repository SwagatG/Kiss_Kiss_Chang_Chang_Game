1) ABOUT THE GAME
________________________________________________________________________________

	The game Kiss Kiss Chang Chang was created by Swagat Ghimire in January
	2016. The characters are inspired by the television series 'Community'
	and the plotline is based on the episode 'Modern Warfare'.
	
	The graphics and audio are taken from various internet resources.
	
	The game was developed in Adobe Flash and code was written in
	ActionScript 3.0.

2) PREMISE
________________________________________________________________________________
	
	The Dean of Greendale Community College has upped the stakes to this
	year's friendly events by introducing a prize: Priority Registration.
	This has escalated the event to an all out war across the campus.
	Realizing that priority registration is actually illegal, Dean Pelton 
	has asked you, Senor Chang: History teacher and Paintball enthusiast, 
	to take out the remaining students.

4) ENEMIES AND BOSSES
________________________________________________________________________________

	Enemies can be seen either walking around or standing. They all shoot
	red paintballs (as opposed to Chang's yellow paintballs).
	
	There are 7 bosses (alphabetically: Abed, Annie, Britta, Jeff, Pierce, 
	Shirley, and Troy) who are much better fighters than other enemies.
	They appear at the end of the level and shoot purple paintballs. In
	later levels their paintballs are much larger.

5) IN GAME RESOURCES
________________________________________________________________________________

	There are three main resources that appear in the game: Energy, Weapons,
	and Ammo. 
	
	Energy allows Senor Chang to dodge paintballs, but when he runs out,
	he will be hit and lose the tournament. Enemies and bosses also have
	energy, but the amount of energy they have is unknown. Paintballs
	take more energy to dodge in later levels. Sometimes enemies will
	drop energy packs upon being eliminated, thus raising your energy.

	Weapons change the speed and power packed by a paintball. That is to 
	say that different weapons can shoot at different rates, and enemies
	will take varying damage based on the type of weapon used. The below
	chart is a brief summary of the weapon types, thier speed and their 
	damage.
	You initially start with one weapon. Beating levels unlocks weapons,
	and there are some weapons hidden for you to find.
	
	WEAPON TYPE		SPEED			DAMAGE
	Pistol			Medium			Low
	Shotgun			Slow			High
	Machine Gun		Fast			Low
	Rifle			Medium			Medium
	Sniper Rifle		Very Slow		Very High

	Ammo limits the number of times you can shoot with a weapon. Some
	weapons have infinite ammo, but the generally rarer or more powerful
	ones have a limited supply. Like energy packs, enemies can, at times,
	drop ammo.
